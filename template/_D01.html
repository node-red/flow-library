<h4>Number of Dependencies</h4>
<h5>Requirements</h5>
<p>The tool will check the number of dependencies in the package.json and warn if there are more than 6.
devDependencies are not counted.</p>
<h5>Reason</h5>
<p>6 was chosen as 95% of all published Node-RED modules had less than 6 dependencies when tested (Oct 2021)
We do see occasionally packages including a large number of unused dependencies including the <code>node-red</code> package itself!
This isnâ€™t meant to be a hard limit just a warning to check that everything in your dependencies list is indeed needed, it is recognised that some packages may have a legitimate reason to have a lot of dependencies and this can be noted in the README</p>
